# udacity_DC_nanoDegree

Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested using Seattle data to better understand the career of data scientists. In particular, the questions I interested in are

- Which factors are affecting price the most and how much they are affecting it?


- Are that apartments, which are underpriced according to our model, receiving more reviews per month?

- In which month of the year prices are the highest?



    Dependences :
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - statsmodels


- File description

- Results of the analysis


In this project, I dived into the most recent Airbnb Seattle dataset and found many interesting information  :

We created a machine learning model to predict the rental price for seattle.

We took a look at the feature importance of the trained model and check if they make sense.

We convene the Seattle Airbnb data, and get deep analysis for the dataset.

We collected and clarified all the important amenities to make get a better feeling how host can make more money by providing better services to meet customersâ€™ need.
